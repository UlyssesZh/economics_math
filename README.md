My conclusions of basic applications of calculus in microeconomics

I am new to microeconomics.
I have just learnt very basic economical theorems.
As a student with math knowledge, I think some theories taught in class are not elegant enough.
Thus, I started to write *Calculus in microeconomics* to make economical theorems look more elegant.
Most of the thoughts irrelevant to principles in economics are made on my own.
Feel free to point out errors.
